# NLP_SemEval

## Requirements

GloVe 100B word embeddings should be installed

## Installation
To use this project, you'll need to download and install the GloVe 100B word embeddings. These pre-trained word vectors are essential for the natural language processing tasks in this repository.
Installing GloVe 100B

- Download the GloVe pre-trained word vectors from Stanford NLP
- Specifically, download the 100-dimensional embeddings trained on 6B tokens (Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5)
- Extract the downloaded file and place the glove.6B.100d.txt file in the appropriate directory of the project

## Project Description
This repository contains code for predicting sentiment for tweets using SemEval datasets, specifically Task 4 of SemEval 2017.
